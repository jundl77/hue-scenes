# hue_scenes

A very simple script to build custom Philips Hue lighting animations / scenes. I used this for Halloween themed animations.

To use this, create your custom animations / scenes by looking at main.py.


### Features
The following features are currently supported:

- iterate through a set of colors, with a configurable transition period and interval
- create flashes on a specified interval
